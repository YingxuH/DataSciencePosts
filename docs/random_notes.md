1. python regex: search: find something anywhere in the string and return a match object. match: find something at the beginning of the string and return a match object.
2. A greedy quantifier such as ?, *, +, and {m,n} matches as many characters as possible (longest match). A non-greedy quantifier such as ??, *?, +?, and {m,n}? matches as few characters as possible (shortest possible match).
3. \s will match \n, while '.' and ' ' will not.
4. lookahead: ?= ?!
