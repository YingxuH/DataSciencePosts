## Architecture
Up to 2023, most of the trending LMs follow the transformer architecture. 

- **Encoder**: Fully visiable structure. No Causal mask.
- **Decoder**: Tokens appearing at subsequent times are masked.
- **Predix LM** (T5): Tokens representing the input prefix/instruction are fully visible to each other, while tokens in the real input can only see the preceding tokens.


### Embeddings 
Compared to traditional RNNs, the sequential feature of the input is not taken care of by the recurrent process. On the contrary, positional embedding handles this. 

The embedding matrix is shared between the input embedding and the output classification process.

#### Positional Embeddings

##### ROPE 

### Attention
> [!NOTE]  
> It Might be quite obvious, but I still want to note here: shared matrix is used for each token in the sequence.

**Time Complexity** (scaled dot product attention): 
- Linear projection from embedding to K, Q, V: $O(N.d^2)$, assuming the simplest case without multihead set up.
- Q x K for the attention matrix: $O(N^{2}.d)$
- Softmax x V for the updated values: $O(N^{2}.d)$
- In total: $O(N^{2}.d + N.d^2)$

> [!NOTE]  
> For additive attention, the similarity function can be represented as $s(Q, K) = V^{T}tanh(W[Q;K])$, where $W$ should has the shape of $d \times d$ and $V$ of $d \times N$, which results in a time complexity of $O(N^{2}.d^{2})$


#### Flash Attention

- The attention operation is bottlenecked by the memory I/O speed of the HBM.
- Split the input into blocks and make several passes over input blocks. Perform the softmax function incrementally without saving the entire matrix to memory. 
- Store the softmax normalization factor for backward passing, which is faster than directing reading the attention matrix from the memory.

#### Sparse Attention


### Point-wise Feed forward layer
- **Expand layer**: (d_model, d_ffn)
- **Contraction layer**: (d_ffn, d_model)

## Pretraining 
### Pre-training objectives
#### Denoising objective
corrupt the input sequence and reproduce it in the output.
- **Bert** (masked language modeling, MLM): corrupts 15% of the tokens. 80% of the corrupted tokens are replaced with a special mask token, 10% are replaced with a random token, and the remaining 10% are unchanged. The task is to reproduce the entire original sequence.
- **Mass style** (T5): replace corrupted tokens with the special mask token.
- **Replace style** (T5): replace the consecutive span of corrupted tokens with a single mask token, and only predict the concatenated corrupted spans. Note that the specific mask token prefixes each span in the target span.
- **drop style** (T5): drop the corrupted tokens from the input.

> [!NOTE]  
> **Replace style** and **drop style** might speed up the training process and require lower computational cost, as the target sequence is shorter. (How to define shorter as still one token has to be produced each time?)

#### Language model objective
> ‚ùì Training will be done at once for all time steps. For example, given the input sequence, each time step will output logits for the next token for speed up.

- **Teacher Forcing**: Each token is predicted given the input tokens extracted from the ground truth sequence. **Likely to cause repetition in decoding.**
- **Curriculum Learning**: Randomly choose to use the ground truth output or the generated output from the previous time step as input for the current time step.

## Quantization
It means a projection from a set of indices to real domains. Typically, people save weights in 32-bit for storage and calculate gradients in 16-bit. 
FP32 and bFP16 (BrainFP16) don't have differences in their ranges.

- **8-bit quantization**: mixed-precision matrix decomposition: 8-bit quantizes the normal states & weights and leaves the outliers unchanged.
- **Normal float 4**: In layman's terms, instead of using the normal "sign-exponent-mantissa" schema to represent actual values, the normal float data type keeps an index value
pair where the kth value is the kth quantile of the source tensor. It's information-theoretically optimal, as they claim!

### LLM.int8()

- It generalizes the block quantization into row/column wise quantization.
- Currently quite slow duel to these [reasons](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/issues/6#issuecomment-1211345635): 
  - The current CUDA kernel is not optimized for outlier extraction.
  - the int8 and fp16 matrix multiplication is run in sequential manner rather than parallel manner. 
  - fp16 matrix multiplication kernel not optimized for extreme matrix sizes. 
  - Interesting view point: int8 matmul might not be much faster than fp16 operations as its difficult to saturate the GPU cores for small models. However, int8 still has overhead occured by the offset parameter. 

### GPTQ
GPTQ is dedicated to quantizing the parameters and updating the weights of other precise parameters to achieve minimal loss derivation compared to the original loss. Generally, any quantization method, such as 8bit, 4bit, etc., can be applied in this case.

Firstly, the optimization approach focuses on each layer: a $d_{out} \times d_{in}$ weight $W$. Secondly, the GPTQ proposes several adjustments based on the Optimal Brain Quantization (OBQ) approach to improve its efficiency and precision. 


**Summarization of OBQ**

For each row of $d_{out}$ in $W$, calculate a Hessian matrix $H_{F}$ for the set of intact input weights $F$, where $H_{F} = 2X_{F}X_{F}^{T}$. Find the optimal greedy-optimal weight $w_{q}$ to quantize next and the updates to the remaining weights $\delta_{F}$ by the following formula. 

<img src="../images/obs_formula.png" alt="obs_formula" width="450"/>

The process is done iteratively for each input parameter and each output parameter, based on the observation that there is no hessian interaction between different output weights, or $\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial{w_{i,j}}\partial{w_{i',j}}}$ = 0. The process takes $O(N.d_{in}^2)$ time to construct the Hessian matrix, $O(d_{in})$ time to find the next optimal parameter, $O(d_{in})$ time to update the remaining parameters, and $O(d_{in}^2)$ time to update its inverse $H_{F}^{-1}$ for each step of removing the row and column $p$. The whole process takes $O(N.d_{in}^2 + d_{out}.k(d_{in}^2 +d_{in}^2))$ time, or simply $O(d_{out}.k.d_{in}^2)$ or $O(d_{out}.d_{in}^3)$ where $k$ stands for the number of input weights you want to quantize for each output weight. Remember the Hessian matrix only needs to be calculated once for all rows. The detailed algorithm is shown below.

**Adjustments**

- **Arbitrary quantization order**: Greedily searching for the next optimal weight to quantize turns out with only marginal benefits over following an arbitrary order. Hence the cheap way is to simply follow the same order to quantize the input parameters for all the output rows. The $H^{-1}$ update process will be the same for all the rows, resulting in a time complexity of $O(d_{in}(d_{out}.d_{in} + d_{in}^2))$, where $O(d_{out}.d_{in})$ is time cost of updating the weights of each row at each time step. Simply, the time complexity can be written as $O(max({d_{out}.d_{in}^2, d_{in}^3)})$.
- **lazy batch updates**: Batch process weights update process for a block of columns. This is based on the intuition that updating the entire weight matrix everytime quantizing one column will trigger too much data I/O process, which might be bottlenecked by the memory bandwidth. During calculation, weights within each batch will be fully updated first before combining their updates and applying to the rest of matrix. Hence, the time cost on updating weights will change from $O(d_{out}.d_{in}^2)$ to $O(d_{out}(\frac{d_{in}}{B}.B^2 + \frac{d_{in}^2}{B}))$, where the first term represent steps calculating the within-batch process and the second term represents the steps updating the weights outside batches. When B is approaching $d_{in}$, the I/O bottleneck caused by the second term will be deminished while the first term turns into the heavy one. On the contrary, the cost reduction on the second term would be trivial if B is too small, so we need to considering the balance between the two terms while determining the value of B. 128 is used in the paper.
- **Cholesky Reformation**: The inverse Hessian matrix can be pre-computed leveraging Cholesky decomposition, further reducing the total complexity to  $O(d_{out}.d_{in}^2)$.

### AWQ

### Llama CPP

- [original 4-bit quantization](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml/pull/27). Intuitively, $QK_0$ stands for absmax quantization while $QK_1$ stands for zero-point quantization. The extra offset parameter in zero-point quantization grants more freedom for the quantized range and thus could save more range, but at a higher computation cost.
- [The original range as a scaling parameter can be adjusted](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/issues/397). Based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05877.pdf), people tends to use moving averate for the max and min of activations. 

> [!NOTE]  
> You can actually determine the range by reconstruction RMSE, etc. Further discussed [here](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/835) and [here](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/896).

- [k quantization](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1684): It uses various different set ups of block quantization, with variances of applying a mixture of quantization strategy on different tensors.

> [!NOTE]  
> The general insight is that the lower the quantization bits, the faster speed the model will be.
